# Breast-Cancer-Prognostication-Using-Machine-Learning
This foundational project builds a machine learning model for breast cancer prognostication using Logistic Regression. It classifies tumors as malignant or benign based on morphological features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. A Flask-based web interface enables users to input tumor characteristics and obtain real-time predictions.
