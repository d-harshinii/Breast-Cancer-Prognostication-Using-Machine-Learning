# Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Prognostication Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based predictive model for the prognostication of breast cancer, leveraging classification algorithms to assess malignancy risk based on patient histopathological data. Utilizing the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) from scikit-learn, the model applies Logistic Regression to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on extracted morphological features.




## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Structured feature extraction and handling of missing values.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Implementation of Logistic Regression with train-test splitting for performance assessment.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluation based on accuracy, sensitivity (recall), and specificity to ensure clinical relevance.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** A Flask-based GUI allowing users to input tumor feature values and obtain real-time predictions.


## Technologies Used

- **Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)** for model development
- **Flask** for deploying a lightweight web-based prediction system
- **HTML/CSS** for UI design and user interaction



This project aims to enhance early detection and prognosis of breast cancer by providing an interpretable and accessible machine learning solution. 

Future enhancements can focus on expanding the dataset to improve model accuracy and generalization, as well as refining the web interface for a more intuitive and visually appealing user experience. These advancements will further strengthen the projectâ€™s role in supporting early breast cancer diagnosis through technology-driven solutions.
